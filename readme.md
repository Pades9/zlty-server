### Marketing description

Tickets for some of the trains belonging to the private company Regiojet(Student agency) are often completely sold out. This application fulfils an easy task which is to get you a ticket. All it takes is to enter the destination and time of your journey. After that the application finds you all of the possible train connections. You can easily save the preferred connection by clicking the “save” button. After that it is all in the hands of the application. If the train connection is sold out, the application sends you a notification whenever a ticket becomes available for the preferred connections. If the preferred train connection is not completely sold out, the application notifies you whenever the number of available tickets drops down below a certain number. 
The application does not fulfil the function of ticket reservation, however. It is only of an informative character and it was developed independently of the Regiojet company. We hope that you will find this application useful.
